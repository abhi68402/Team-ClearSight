## Abstract:

In modern virtual communication, poor video clarity due to limited bandwidth or network noise can degrade user experience. This project addresses this challenge by developing an ultra-lightweight image sharpening model capable of operating in real-time (30â€“60 FPS) while retaining the performance of a heavier pre-trained teacher model. The solution employs a **Knowledge Distillation (KD)** framework where a **SwinIR** model serves as the teacher, and a compact **IMDN** model is trained to replicate its sharpening capabilities.

## Problem Statement:

 **Objective**: Enhance image sharpness during video conferencing by reducing blurriness caused by compression and network issues.

 **Approach**: Use a teacher-student KD technique to distill knowledge from a computationally expensive model into a real-time lightweight model.
